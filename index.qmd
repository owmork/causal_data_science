## Course description

::: {style="background-color: #0F2231; border-radius: .25rem; padding: 15px"}
**Distinguishing causal relationships from simple correlation** is what commonly used approaches in business analytics often fall short of. In this course, we will provide you with the **skill set to answer questions like**

-   *what happens to* $Y$ *if we do* $X$*?*
-   *was it* $X$ *that caused* $Y$ *to change?*

Introducing you to **causal inference with the help of data science** will allow you to **carry out state-of-the-art causal analyses** by yourself and **extrapolate causal knowledge** **across different business contexts and various management areas.**
